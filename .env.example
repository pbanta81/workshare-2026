# Portfolio Password Configuration
# =================================
# Each password needs a HASH and either a SLUG (for embedded content) or URL (for redirect)
# 
# To generate a hash:
#   node scripts/generate-hash.mjs "your-password"
#
# You can have up to 10 different passwords (PORTFOLIO_1 through PORTFOLIO_10)

# Example with embedded content (loads content in-page):
# PORTFOLIO_1_HASH=5e884898da28047d91078b6b9f92be6e65a96e1d6b2e5a6e6e6b6e6e6b6e6e6b
# PORTFOLIO_1_SLUG=test-portfolio
#
# The SLUG should match a file in src/content/portfolios/ (e.g., test-portfolio.mdx)

# Example with redirect (sends user to external URL):
# PORTFOLIO_2_HASH=another-sha256-hash-here
# PORTFOLIO_2_URL=https://external-portfolio-url.com

# Add these environment variables in Vercel:
# 1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
# 2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
# 3. Add each PORTFOLIO_X_HASH and PORTFOLIO_X_SLUG (or _URL) pair
